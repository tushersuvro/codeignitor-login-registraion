###################

It is a basic login/registration setup using CI framework for jump starting project quickly.

*******************
Project Setup
*******************

Downloading or cloning the repo ci_basic.sql needs to be imported into db and change the configuration in config/database.php

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
